gold_game

This project is a game that is built with the framework flask and using python/html/css. Using bootstrap to make the css look cleaner. 

There are multiple levels to this game. 4 ways to aquire the gold and 1 way to lose the gold or get lucky and gain more gold. There should be a status bar indicating how much gold you have overall, and an actvity log that will show what you have done within the game (Ex. spending gold at a casino or making gold by working on a farm).
